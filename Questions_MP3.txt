// cow
1) what is cow? explain in brief ? kyun jarroat hoti hai? - when fork is called a new process is created. the info about the process is associated with a page table. if a read process is called, then the contents if the page table are not duplicated, the access to the read is given to the page table there itself. but if a write is called, then a duplicate copy of the page table is created in which the changes are made, i.e the user can write. advantaeg of this is performance improves (memory + time).

2) what is uvmcopy? kya kya changes kare the? - memory of the child process created is allocated using uvmcopy. this process involves dealing with flags, mapping the physical address to the page table, and updating these prameters if reqd.

3)what is usertrap? kya kya changes kare the? - page fault is generated whenever a write is executed in a cow. this fault is caught in the usertrap. if flags of the page table are invalied, then we kill the process, else memory is allocated for the new page table and the respective contents are copied to this new address, and pte now points to this new physical address.

4) what is copyout? - this function copies from source to destination virtual address. (i.e from kernel to process's user space memory, i. translates userspace addresses into kernel addresses). it also helps to avoid race condition.


// pbs
1) dynamic priority and rbi kaise update kar rha hun? - dynamic priority is the priority given to the process with max. for every tick, we do bookkeeeping, sp is the one jo hamare haat mai hoti hai, dp is the one jo system set karta hai. 

2) if same priority, how am i breaking the tie? - jiska creation time pehle hai that will get the higher priority

3) in schedulertest, why are i/o-bound processes scheduled jyada baar? - because they take less time. since they sepnd more time being blocked, becase they are sleeping for more time, their stime increases, so their rbi decreases.
